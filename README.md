## Project Description

Recession is said to occur when there is constant fall in GDP of a country for two consecutive quarters. While some economists say when overall "economy" is not doing well. However, there are no specific factors to laid out which are defined to identify if a country is under recession. We want to propose a solution to this problem using EDA.Specifically, we want to use EDA on data available on years in which recession occurred and analyze co-relating factors contributing to the recession. (Specific to USA).In other words, we want to perform EDA to be able pinpoint specific factors which clearly indicates that a recession in going occur.

For finding features contributing to recession we will be using different financial datasets combined together in which the target variable will represent the period of expansion or recession. For the target variable, the value “1” will represent a period of recession and the value “0” will represent a period of expansion. This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The dataset has a frequency of a month.
