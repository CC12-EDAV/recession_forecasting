While some economists say when overall “economy” is not doing well. However, there are no specific factors to laid out which are defined to identify if a country is under recession. We want to propose a solution to this problem using EDA.Specifically, we want to use EDA on data available on years in which recession occurred and analyze co-relating factors contributing to the recession. (Specific to USA).In other words, we want to perform EDA to be able pinpoint specific factors which clearly indicates that a recession in going occur. 2.1 Research topic Factors Contributing to a Recession 2.2 Data availability For finding features contributing to recession we will be using different financial datasets combined together in which the target variable will represent the period of expansion or recession. For the target variable, the value “1” will represent a period of recession and the value “0” will represent a period of expansion. This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The dataset has a frequency of a month. For identifying the possible features, we are using 6 different time series which will form the final dataset after combining all the time series together. 3 months Bill rate: This is a 3-Months Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The source of the dataset is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US). Update frequency: Monthly.

Capacity Utilization, Manufacturing: This is a Capacity Utilization of the manufacturing sector in the USA. The capacity utilization rate for a particular industry is equal to an output index divided by a capacity index. The Federal Reserve Board’s capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainable maximum output-the greatest level of output a plant can maintain within the framework of a realistic work schedule, after factoring in normal downtime and assuming sufficient availability of inputs to operate the capital in place. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The source of the dataset is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US). Update frequency: Monthly.

Industrial Production: The industrial production (IP) index measures the real output of all relevant establishments located in the United States, regardless of their ownership, but not those located in U.S. territories. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The source of the dataset is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US). Update frequency: Monthly.

CPI Index: is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Indexes are available for the U.S. and various geographic areas. Average price data for select utility, automotive fuel, and food items are also available. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The source of the dataset is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US). Update frequency: Monthly.

For further information regarding treasury constant maturity data, please refer to the H.15 Statistical Release notes and the Treasury Yield Curve Methodology. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED the economic database of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. The source of the dataset is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US).

Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. Labor force data are restricted to people 16 years of age and older, who currently reside in 1 of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, who do not reside in institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces. The dataset can be retrieved from FRED. The source of the dataset is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Update frequency: Monthly.

Recession Indicator: This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Our time series is composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and recession. The NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without designating a date within the period that turning points occurred. The dummy variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a specific date within the period. The arbitrary convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins the first day of the period following a peak and ends on the last day of the period of the trough.

The most logical join for this problem will be to use the inner join that will keep the date column common to each one of then and accordingly append the other columns of the dataset. To do this in R programming language we will have to use the function merge which by default does inner join moreover out of many available ways we have chosen to do that using nested merge. 3.1 Sources We have used all the datasets downloaded from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) with an average of monthly update on their dataset. 3 months Bill rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS Capacity Utilization, Manufacturing: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUMFNS Industrial Production: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO CPI Index: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS 10 Years Rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GS10 Unemployment Rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE Recession Indicator: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USREC 3.2 Cleaning / transformation months_bill &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./TB3MS.csv&#39;) capacity_utilization &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./CUMFNS.csv&#39;) industrial_prod &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./INDPRO.csv&#39;) cpi_index &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./CPIAUCNS.csv&#39;) year_rate_10 &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./GS10.csv&#39;) unemployment_rate &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./UNRATE.csv&#39;) us_recession &lt;- read.csv(&#39;./USREC.csv&#39;) colnames(months_bill) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;TB3MS&quot; colnames(capacity_utilization) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;CUMFNS&quot; colnames(industrial_prod) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;INDPRO&quot; colnames(cpi_index) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;CPIAUCNS&quot; colnames(year_rate_10) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;GS10&quot; colnames(unemployment_rate) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;UNRATE&quot; colnames(us_recession) ## [1] &quot;DATE&quot; &quot;USREC&quot; #All have common col called DATE, and since our target variable is recession we have to get data filtered according to the available DATE in recession table. data &lt;- merge(x = year_rate_10, y = merge(x = unemployment_rate, y = merge(x = capacity_utilization, y = merge(x = months_bill, y = merge(x = industrial_prod, y = merge(x = cpi_index, y = us_recession), by = &#39;DATE&#39;), by = &#39;DATE&#39;), by = &#39;DATE&#39;), by = &#39;DATE&#39;), by = &#39;DATE&#39;) which(is.na(data)) ## integer(0) #write.csv(data, &#39;./recession_forecasting_data.csv&#39;) Each dataframe have a common value named DATE on which we will merge, to do that as explained before we will inner join the frames using merge function that does it by default, since our initial data frames doesn’t had NaN values, our resulting values is not showing signs of NaN or missing values. This can be shown in a graphical way in the following section. 3.3 Missing value analysis install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) ## Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages remotes::install_github(&quot;jtr13/redav&quot;) install.packages(&quot;redav&quot;) ## Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages library(redav) plot_missing(data, percent = FALSE) Notice that there are three parts in the plotted graph. The top part shows the number of missing values in each column. The middle part presents the missing patterns and the right part shows the counts for each missing patterns. If there had been any missing values, it would have been displayed in the middle part of the graph and the top part would have shown the number of those missing values and the right part would have shown the counts for each missing patterns. But our data set doesn’t have any missing values so the graph is empty with num of rows missing and the row count of missing values being zero.
